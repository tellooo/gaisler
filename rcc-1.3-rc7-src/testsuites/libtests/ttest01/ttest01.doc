This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: ttest01

The test-*.c files must place the license header at the bottom of the file.
This allows a copy and paste of the test code into documentation sources and
enables a constant line numbering between the documentation code fragments and
the actual test output.  For the same reason the T_TEST_OUTPUT() macros must be
placed after the actual test cases.  The test source files are dual licensed
BSD-2-Clause and CC-BY-SA-4.0.

directives:

  - RTEMS Test Framework

concepts:

  - Provide examples for the RTEMS Test Framework.
  - Ensure that the RTEMS Test Framework works.
