This directory contains Microsemi specific files.

# genregtable.tcl
Takes a .reg initialization description file generated by Microsemi Libero and
generates an assembly snipppet with offset-value pairs. The output file can be
included in a "bdinit" assembly source.

# bdinit.S
This is a template which implement the MKPROM bdinit0, bdinit1 and bdinit2
functions.

If the preprocessor define SERDES_APB is not zero, then a file named
serdes_init.inc is included as an initialization table and its content is
written to the location described by SERDES_APB.  Bit 5 at offset 0x2008 is
cleared before the initialization and the same bit is set afterwards.

If the preprocessor define MDDR_APB is not zero, then a file named
mddr_init.inc is included and its content is written to the location described
by MDDRP_APB.
