# ABOUT
This directory contains example files for generating a bdinit.o for the
Microsemi IGLOO2 FPGA Evaluation Kit (M2GL_M2S-EVAL-KIT).


# USAGE
  $ make
Then use the resulting bdinit.o with the MKPROM -bdinit option.

## mddr_init.inc
Contains initialization offsets and values for the MDDR memory controller.

## serdes_init.inc
Contains initialization offsets and values for the SERDES controller.


# OPTIONS
## CC
Make variable CC can be used to specify the toolchain to use, for example:
  $ make CC=sparc-rtems-gcc

## MDDR_APB
The MDDR_APB make variable specifies where the MDDR APB interface is located as
seen by the processor. To specify that the APB interface is located at bus
address 0x90001000, use:
  $ make MDDR_APB=0x90001000

It is also possible to disable the MDDR initialization by using MDDR_APB=0.

## SERDES_APB
The same options apply for the SERDES controller and the make variable SERDES_APB.


# CUSTOMIZATION
For custom designs, the provided .reg files can be replaced by files generated
by Microsemi Libero.
