1.1 Introduction
================

These error reporting facilities are an RTEMS support component that
provide convenient facilities for handling error conditions in an RTEMS
application.  of each task using a period.  The services provided by
the error reporting support component are:

   * `rtems_error' - Report an Error

   * `rtems_panic' - Report an Error and Panic

   * `rtems_status_text' - ASCII Version of RTEMS Status

1.2.1 Error Handling in an Embedded System
------------------------------------------

Error handling in an embedded system is a difficult problem.  If the
error is severe, then the only recourse is to shut the system down in a
safe manner.  Other errors can be detected and compensated for.  The
error reporting routines in this support component - `rtems_error' and
`rtems_panic' assume that if the error is severe enough, then the
system should be shutdown.  If a simple shutdown with some basic
diagnostic information is not sufficient, then these routines should
not be used in that particular system.  In this case, use the
`rtems_status_text' routine to construct an application specific error
reporting routine.

1.3.1 Reporting an Error
------------------------

The `rtems_error' and `rtems_panic' routines can be used to print some
diagnostic information and shut the system down.  The `rtems_error'
routine is invoked with a user specified error level indicator.  This
error indicator is used to determine if the system should be shutdown
after reporting this error.

Returns the number of characters written.

DESCRIPTION:
------------

This routine prints the requested information as specified by the
`printf_format' parameter and the zero or more optional arguments
following that parameter.  The `error_code' parameter is an error
number with either `RTEMS_ERROR_PANIC' or `RTEMS_ERROR_ABORT' bitwise
or'ed with it.  If the `RTEMS_ERROR_PANIC' bit is set, then then the
system is system is shutdown via a call to `_exit'.  If the
`RTEMS_ERROR_ABORT' bit is set, then then the system is system is
shutdown via a call to `abort'.

2.1 Introduction
================

The monitor task is a simple interactive shell that allows the user to
make inquries about he state of various system objects.  The routines
provided by the monitor task manager are:

   * `rtems_monitor_init' - Initialize the Monitor Task

   * `rtems_monitor_wakeup' - Wakeup the Monitor Task

2.3.1 Initializing the Monitor
------------------------------

The monitor is initialized by calling `rtems_monitor_init'.  When
initialized, the monitor is created as an independent task.  An example
of initializing the monitor is shown below:

     #include <rtems/monitor.h>
             ...
     rtems_monitor_init(0);

The "0" parameter to the `rtems_monitor_init' routine causes the
monitor to immediately enter command mode.  This parameter is a
bitfield.  If the monitor is to suspend itself on startup, then the
`RTEMS_MONITOR_SUSPEND' bit should be set.

------------------------------------------------------

CALLING SEQUENCE:
-----------------

     void rtems_monitor_init(
       unsigned32 monitor_flags
     );

STATUS CODES: NONE
------------------

DESCRIPTION:
------------

This routine initializes the RTEMS monitor task.  The `monitor_flags'
parameter indicates how the server task is to start.  This parameter is
a bitfield and has the following constants associated with it:

   * RTEMS_MONITOR_SUSPEND - suspend monitor on startup

   * RTEMS_MONITOR_GLOBAL - monitor should be global

If the `RTEMS_MONITOR_SUSPEND' bit is set, then the monitor task will
suspend itself after it is initialized.  A subsequent call to
`rtems_monitor_wakeup' will be required to activate it.

NOTES:
------

The monitor task is created with priority 1.  If there are application
tasks at priority 1, then there may be times when the monitor task is
not executing.
