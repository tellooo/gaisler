1.1 Supporting Tools
====================

* Menu:

* GNU Development Tools::
* ANSI C Libraries::
* GNU C Library::
* Cygnus NEWLIB C Library::

This section discusses the freely available tools and libraries which
are part of the RTEMS Development Environment.  None of the tools
discussed in this section were developed by the RTEMS project, although
many do include submissions from the project.  All of the tools and
libraries required to build RTEMS are freely available.  The home ftp
site for most of the non-RTEMS specific tools is either prep.ai.mit.edu
(18.71.0.38) or ftp.cygnus.com (140.174.1.3).

Specifically of interest to embedded systems developers using the GNU
tools is the crossgcc mailing list.  This is a Majordomo style mailing
list and may be subscribed to by sending a message to
crossgcc-request@cygnus.com with the following line as the body:

     subscribe rtems_user@your_email_goes_here.com

Please replace rtems_user@your_email_goes_here.com with your email
address.  The FAQ for crossgcc is in the /pub/embedded/crossgcc
directory on ftp.cygnus.com (205.180.83.42).

1.1.1 GNU Development Tools
---------------------------

Numerous GNU tools are used in the RTEMS Development Environment
including C and Ada compilers, the GNU make program, GNU m4, the GNU
assembler and binary utilities (linker, librarian, etc.), GNU tar, GNU
zip, and the GNU debugger.  These tools are distributed in source form
and are all licensed under the GNU Public License which allows for
unrestricted distribution under the condition that source code always be
available.  The Free Software Foundation is officially the originator
of most of the GNU tools although many individuals have contributed to
the GNU projects.  In keeping with the spirit of the GPL,  most of the
time the GNU tools are distributed as source code without executables.
It is the responsibility of the local site to install each tool.
Numerous organizations and individuals supply executables for the GNU
tools.  All are required by the terms of the GPL to also make the
source code available to the end user.

The primary ftp site for the FSF GNU tools is prep.ai.mit.edu
(18.71.0.38) in the /pub/gnu directory.  These tools are mirrored on
numerous ftp sites.

Cygnus maintains an ftp site - ftp.cygnus.com (205.180.83.42) - which
contains a source code which appeals to embedded developers.  Of
especial interest on this site are the directories /pub/newlib and
/pub/embedded.

1.1.2 ANSI C Libraries
----------------------

This section discusses the following freely distributable ANSI C
Libraries:

   * GNU C Library, and

   * Cygnus NEWLIB

No C Library is included in the standard RTEMS distribution.  It is the
responsibility of the user to obtain and install a C Library separately.


File: relnotes.info,  Node: GNU C Library,  Next: Cygnus NEWLIB C Library,  Prev: ANSI C Libraries,  Up: Introduction Supporting Tools

1.1.3 GNU C Library
-------------------

The GNU C Library is a robust and well-documented C Library which is
distributed under the terms of the Library GNU Public License (LGPL).
This library was not designed for use in real-time, embedded systems
and the resource requirements of some of the routines in this library
are an obvious indication of this.  Additionally, this library does not
have support for reentrancy in the sense that each task in a
multitasking system could safely invoke every routine in the library.
Finally, the distribution terms of the LGPL are considered undesirable
by many embedded systems developers.  However, the GNU C Library is
very complete and is compliant with as many standards as possible.
Because of this, it may be the only choice for many developers.

There is currently no RTEMS support for the GNU C Library.

The primary ftp site for this library is prep.ai.mit.edu (18.71.0.38).

1.1.4 Cygnus NEWLIB C Library
-----------------------------

The Cygnus NEWLIB C Library was specifically designed for real-time
embedded systems.  It is a small, reasonably documented Library with
support for reentrancy.  This library is a collection of freely
distributable and public domain source code and is freely distributable
with as few restrictions as possible placed on the end user.

The primary ftp site for this library is ftp.cygnus.com (205.180.83.42).

2.1 Introduction
================

This chapter describes the process of installing and configuring RTEMS
and a cross-development environment based on freely available tools and
libraries.


File: relnotes.info,  Node: Installation Procedure RTEMS FTP Site Organization,  Next: Installation Procedure Unarchiving the RTEMS and GNU Components,  Prev: Installation Procedure Introduction,  Up: Installation Procedure

2.2 RTEMS FTP Site Organization
===============================

RTEMS is distributed only via anonymous ftp.

This section will discuss how to navigate the RTEMS ftp site and
unarchive the files in the RTEMS and GNU package distributions.  All
example commands will be given in a shell independent fashion unless
otherwise noted.

Throughout the rest of this manual <RTEMS_distribution> will be used as
the parent of components within the RTEMS distribution.  For persons
using the ftp distribution found on the primary ftp site for RTEMS,
<RTEMS_distribution> are found under this directory
`ftp://ftp.rtems.com/pub/rtems/'.  HTTP access to the ftp site is
available via `http://www.rtems.com/ftp/pub/rtems'.

The archive files for RTEMS Release 4.10.2 are found under the
directory <RTEMS_distribution>.  This directory contains the files
which comprise this relase as well as any patches which may be required
for other tools.

The complete source code and documentation set for the C language
implementation of RTEMS is provided.

2.3 Unarchiving the RTEMS and GNU Components
============================================

Many of the components of the RTEMS release are "tarred, zipped" files
and have the .tar.gz or .tgz extension.  The GNU zip package is
required to unarchives these files on the RTEMS ftp site.  If this
package is not installed, the source can be found in the files
`ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gzip/gzip-1.2.4.shar' or
`ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gzip/gzip-1.2.4.tar'.  It may be restored
using a command similar to the following:

     tar xvf gzip-1.2.4.tar

     OR

     sh gzip-1.2.4.shar

This will create a subdirectory gzip-1.2.4 in the current directory.
Please examine the files README and INSTALL and follow the instructions
provided there.

[Note: The GNU tools follow a standard packaging procedure They will
unarchive into a directory based on the package name and version
number.  For detailed instructions on compilation and installation of
the GNU tools, please refer to the instructions for each GNU tool.]

Files which have been "tarred, zipped" (i.e.  .tar.gz or .tgz
extension) may be unarchived with a command similar to one of the
following:

     gzcat <file>.tgz | tar xvof -

     OR

     gunzip -c <file>.tgz | tar xvof -

     OR

     gtar xzvf <file>.tgz

NOTE: gunzip -c is equivalent to gzcat, while gtar is GNU tar.

Given that the necessary utility programs are installed, any of the
above commands will extract the contents of <file>.tar.gz into the
current directory.  All of the RTEMS components will be extracted into
the subdirectory rtems-4.10.2.  To view the contents of a component
without restoring any files, use a command similar to the following:

     gzcat <file>.tgz | tar tvf -

2.4 Installing a Cross-Development GNU Toolset
==============================================

This sections describes how to build and install the FSF GNU tools for
use as a cross-compilation system.  These tools are used by the RTEMS
developers.  Every effort has been made to make these instructions
accurate and complete.  However, it is recommended that the individual
doing the installation read the appropriate installation notes for each
of the tools in the cross toolset.  This will help insure that there
are no special requirements for a particular host.

If the host and target processors are the same, then it may be possible
to use the host development tools.  An example of this scenario is
using a SPARC based workstation to develop an RTEMS application for the
SPARC processor.  Although the native toolset is useable in this
scenario, it is ultimately more desirable to build a toolset
specifically for the embedded environment.

Instructions for building a cross environment using the GNU tools is
provided in the crossgcc FAQ available from ftp.cygnus.com in
/pub/embedded/crossgcc.  It is recommended that the user following
these instructions.

After the cross development toolset has been built and installed, it
will be necessary to modify the environment of each RTEMS application
developer to reflect at least the path of the newly installed cross
development toolset.

The documentation for the FSF GNU and Cygnus tools is formatted using
TeX.  The RTEMS developers use TeX 3.14t3 to format the manuals for
their own use.  This document does not contain instructions on the
acquisition or installation of TeX and supporting tools.

NOTE: For "UNIX" processors, the native compiler binary utilities
should be used.
