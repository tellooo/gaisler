<H2>2.4: Installing a Cross-Development GNU Toolset</H2>
<P>
This sections describes how to build and install the
FSF GNU tools for use as a cross-compilation system.  These
tools are used by the RTEMS developers.  Every effort has been
made to make these instructions accurate and complete.  However,
it is recommended that the individual doing the installation
read the appropriate installation notes for each of the tools in
the cross toolset.  This will help insure that there are no
special requirements for a particular host.
</P>
<P>
If the host and target processors are the same, then
it may be possible to use the host development tools.  An
example of this scenario is using a SPARC based workstation
to develop an RTEMS application for the SPARC processor.  Although
the native toolset is useable in this scenario, it is ultimately
more desirable to build a toolset specifically for the embedded environment.
</P>
<P>
Instructions for building a cross environment using the GNU
tools is provided in the crossgcc FAQ available from ftp.cygnus.com
in /pub/embedded/crossgcc.  It is recommended that the user following
these instructions.
</P>
<P>
After the cross development toolset has been built
and installed, it will be necessary to modify the environment of
each RTEMS application developer to reflect at least the path of
the newly installed cross development toolset.
</P>
<P>
The documentation for the FSF GNU and Cygnus tools is
formatted using TeX.  The RTEMS developers use TeX 3.14t3 to
format the manuals for their own use.  This document does not
contain instructions on the acquisition or installation of TeX
and supporting tools.
</P>
<P>
NOTE: For &quot;UNIX&quot; processors, the native compiler binary utilities
should be used.
