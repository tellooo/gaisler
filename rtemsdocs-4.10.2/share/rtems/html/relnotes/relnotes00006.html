<H3>1.1.3: GNU C Library</H3>
<P>
The GNU C Library is a robust and well-documented C
Library which is distributed under the terms of the Library GNU
Public License (LGPL).  This library was not designed for use in
real-time, embedded systems and the resource requirements of
some of the routines in this library are an obvious indication
of this.  Additionally, this library does not have support for
reentrancy in the sense that each task in a multitasking system
could safely invoke every routine in the library.  Finally, the
distribution terms of the LGPL are considered undesirable by
many embedded systems developers.  However, the GNU C Library is
very complete and is compliant with as many standards as
possible.  Because of this, it may be the only choice for many
developers.
</P>
<P>
There is currently no RTEMS support for the GNU C Library.

<P>
The primary ftp site for this library is
prep.ai.mit.edu (18.71.0.38).
