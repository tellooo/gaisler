<H2>2.3: testsuites/ Test Suites</H2>
<P>
This directory provides all of the RTEMS Test Suite
except those for the Classic API Ada95 binding
This includes the single processor tests, multiprocessor tests,
timing tests, library tests, and sample tests.   Additionally,
subdirectories for support functions and test related header
files are provided.  The following table lists the test suites
currently included with the RTEMS and the directory in which
they may be located:
</P>
<DL>
<DT><CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/itrontests/</CODE>
<DD>
This directory contains the test suite for the
RTEMS ITRON API.

<DT><CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/libtests/</CODE>
<DD>
This directory contains the test suite for the
various RTEMS support components.

<DT><CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/mptests/</CODE>
<DD>
This directory contains the test suite for the
multiprocessor support in the Classic API.
The tests provided address two node configurations
and provide coverage for the multiprocessor code found
in RTEMS.

<DT><CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/psxtests/</CODE>
<DD>
This directory contains the test suite for the
RTEMS POSIX API.

<DT><CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/</CODE>
<DD>
This directory provides sample application tests
which aid in the testing a newly built RTEMS environment, a new
BSP, or as starting points for the development of an application
using the RTEMS executive.  They are discussed in
<A HREF="develenv00010.html">Sample Applications</A>.

<DT><CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/sptests/</CODE>
<DD>
This directory contains the test suite for the RTEMS
Classic API when executing on a single processor.
The tests were originally designed to provide
near complete test coverage for the entire
executive code.  With the addition of multiple APIs,
this is no longer the case as some SuperCore functionality
is not available through the Classic API.  Thus
some functionality in the SuperCore is only covered
by tests in the POSIX API and ITRON API Test Suites.

<DT><CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/support/</CODE>
<DD>
This directory contains support software and header files
for the various test suites.

<DT><CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/tmitrontests/</CODE>
<DD>
This directory contains the timing test suite for
the RTEMS ITRON API.

<DT><CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/tmtests/</CODE>
<DD>
This directory contains the timing test suite for
the RTEMS Classic API.  This include tests that
benchmark each directive in the Classic API
as well as a set of critical SuperCore functions.
These tests are important for helping to verify
that RTEMS performs as expected on your target hardware.
It is not uncommon to discover mistakes in board
initialization such as caching being disabled as
a side-effect of analyzing the results of these tests.

<DT><CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/tools/</CODE>
<DD>
This directory contains tools which execute on
the development host and aid in executing and
evaluating the results of the test suite.  The
tools <CODE>difftest</CODE> compares the output of one
or more tests with the expected output.  If you
place the output of all the <CODE>tmtests/</CODE> in
a single file, then the utility <CODE>sorttimes</CODE>
will be able to produce a report organizing the
execution times by manager.
