<H2>3.1: Introduction</H2>
<P>
The RTEMS source distribution includes a set of sample applications
that are located in the <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/</CODE>
directory.  These applications are intended to illustrate the
basic format of RTEMS single and multiple processor
applications and the use of some features.  In addition, these
relatively simple applications can be used to test locally
developed board support packages and device drivers as they
exercise a critical subset of RTEMS functionality that is often
broken in new BSPs.
</P>
<P>
Some of the following sample applications will be covered in
more detail in subsequent sections:
</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Hello World</STRONG>
<DD>
The RTEMS Hello World test is provided in
the subdirectory <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/hello/</CODE>.
This test is helpful when testing new RTEMS development environment.

<DT><STRONG>Clock Tick</STRONG>
<DD>
The <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/ticker/</CODE>
subdirectory provides a test for verification of clock chip
device drivers of BSPs.

<DT><STRONG>Base Single Processor</STRONG>
<DD>
A simple single processor test similar to those in the
single processor test suite is provided in
<CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/base_sp/</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG>Base Multiple Processor</STRONG>
<DD>
A simple two node multiprocessor test capable of testing an newly
developed MPCI layer is provided in
<CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/base_mp/</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG>Capture</STRONG>
<DD>
The RTEMS Capture test is provided in
the subdirectory <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/capture/</CODE>.
This is an interactive test which demonstrates the capabilities
of the RTEMS Capture Engine.  It includes a few test threads
which generate interesting execution patterns.  Look at the
file <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/capture/capture.scn</CODE>
for a sample session.

<DT><STRONG>Constructor/Destructor C++ Test</STRONG>
<DD>
The <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/cdtest/</CODE>
subdirectory provides a simple C++ application using
constructors and destructors.  It is only built when
C++ is enabled and its primary purpose is to demonstrate
that global constructors and destructors work.  Since this
requires that the linker script for your BSP be correct, this is
an important test.

<DT><STRONG>File IO</STRONG>
<DD>
The RTEMS File IO test is provided in
the subdirectory <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/fileio/</CODE>.
This is an interactive test which allows the user to interact with
an ATA/IDE device.  It will read the partition table and allow the
user to dynamically mount one of the FAT32 partitions it finds.
Commands are also provided to write and read files on the disk.

<DT><STRONG>IO Stream</STRONG>
<DD>
The RTEMS IO Stream test is provided in
the subdirectory <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/iostream/</CODE>.
This test is a simple C++ application which demonstrates that
C++ iostreams are functional. This requires that the RTEMS C++
run-time support is functioning properly.  This test is only
build when C++ is enabled.

<DT><STRONG>Network Loopback Test</STRONG>
<DD>
The <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/loopback/</CODE>
directory contains a sample test that demonstrates the use of
sockets and the loopback network device.  It does not require
the presence of network hardware in order to run.
It is only built if RTEMS was configured with networking enabled.

<DT><STRONG>Minimum Size Test</STRONG>
<DD>
The directory
<CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/minimum/</CODE>
contains a simple RTEMS program that results in a non-functional
executable.  It is intended to show the size of a minimum footprint
application based upon the current RTEMS configuration.

<DT><STRONG>Nanoseconds</STRONG>
<DD>
The RTEMS Nanoseconds test is provided in
the subdirectory <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/nsecs/</CODE>.
This test demonstrates that the BSP has support for nanosecond
timestamp granularity.  It prints the time of day and uptime multiple
times as quickly as possible.  It should be possible from the output
to determine if your BSP has nanosecond accurate clock support
and it is functional.

<DT><STRONG>Paranoia Floating Point Test</STRONG>
<DD>
The directory <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/paranoia/</CODE>
contains the public domain floating point and math library test.

<DT><STRONG>Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon</STRONG>
<DD>
The RTEMS Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon test is provided in
the subdirectory <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/pppd/</CODE>.
This test primarily serves as the baseline for a user application
using the PPP protocol.

<DT><STRONG>Unlimited Object Allocation</STRONG>
<DD>
The <CODE>${RTEMS_ROOT}/testsuites/samples/unlimited/</CODE>
directory contains a sample test that demonstrates the use of the
<EM>unlimited</EM> object allocation configuration option to RTEMS.

</DL>
<P>
The sample tests are written using the Classic API so the reader
should be familiar with the terms used and
material presented in the <STRONG>RTEMS Applications Users Guide</STRONG>.
