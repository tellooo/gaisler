<P>
This section describes the additional commands
available within the <STRONG>RTEMS Development Environment</STRONG>.  Although
some of these commands are of general use, most are included to
provide some capability necessary to perform a required function
in the development of the RTEMS executive, one of its support
components, or an RTEMS based application.
</P>
<P>
Some of the commands are implemented as C programs.
However, most commands are implemented as Bourne shell scripts.
Even if the current user has selected a different shell, the
scripts will automatically invoke the Bourne shell during their
execution lifetime.
</P>
<P>
The commands are presented in UNIX manual page style
for compatibility and convenience.  A standard set of paragraph
headers were used for all of the command descriptions.  If a
section contained no data, the paragraph header was omitted to
conserve space.  Each of the permissible paragraph headers and
their contents are described below:
</P>
<DL>
<DT><CODE>SYNOPSIS</CODE>
<DD>
describes the command syntax

<DT><CODE>DESCRIPTION</CODE>
<DD>
a full description of the command

<DT><CODE>OPTIONS</CODE>
<DD>
describes each of the permissible options for the command

<DT><CODE>NOTES</CODE>
<DD>
lists any special noteworthy comments about the command

<DT><CODE>ENVIRONMENT</CODE>
<DD>
describes all environment variables utilized by the command

<DT><CODE>EXAMPLES</CODE>
<DD>
illustrates the use of the command with specific examples

<DT><CODE>FILES</CODE>
<DD>
provides a list of major files that the command references

<DT><CODE>SEE ALSO</CODE>
<DD>
lists any relevant commands which can be consulted
</DL>

<P>
Most environment variables referenced by the commands
are defined for the RTEMS Development Environment during the
login procedure.  During login, the user selects a default RTEMS
environment through the use of the Modules package.  This tool
effectively sets the environment variables to provide a
consistent development environment for a specific user.
Additional environment variables within the RTEMS environment
were set by the system administrator during installation.  When
specifying paths, a command description makes use of these
environment variables.
</P>
<P>
When referencing other commands in the SEE ALSO
paragraph, the following notation is used:   command(code).
Where command is the name of a related command, and code is a
section number.  Valid section numbers are as follows:
</P>
<DL>
<DT><CODE>1</CODE>
<DD>
Section 1 of the standard UNIX documentation

<DT><CODE>1G</CODE>
<DD>
Section 1 of the GNU documentation

<DT><CODE>1R</CODE>
<DD>
a manual page from this document, the RTEMS Development Environment Guide
</DL>

<P>
For example, ls(1) means see the standard ls command
in section 1 of the UNIX documentation.  gcc020(1G) means see
the description of gcc020 in section 1 of the GNU documentation.
