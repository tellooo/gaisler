<H2>1.1: Real-Time Embedded Systems</H2>
<P>
Real-time embedded systems are found in practically every facet of our
everyday lives.  Today's systems range from the common telephone, automobile
control systems, and kitchen appliances to complex air traffic control
systems, military weapon systems, and production line control including
robotics and automation. However, in the current climate of rapidly changing
technology, it is difficult to reach a consensus on the definition of a
real-time embedded system. Hardware costs are continuing to rapidly decline
while at the same time the hardware is increasing in power and functionality.
As a result, embedded systems that were not considered viable two years ago
are suddenly a cost effective solution. In this domain, it is not uncommon
for a single hardware configuration to employ a variety of architectures and
technologies. Therefore, we shall define an embedded system as any computer
system that is built into a larger system consisting of multiple technologies
such as digital and analog electronics,  mechanical devices, and sensors.
</P>
<P>
Even as hardware platforms become more powerful, most embedded systems are
critically dependent on the real-time software embedded in the systems
themselves.  Regardless of how efficiently the hardware operates, the
performance of the embedded real-time software determines the success of the
system.  As the complexity of the embedded hardware platform grows, so does
the size and complexity of the embedded software. Software systems must
routinely perform activities which were only dreamed of a short time ago.
These large, complex, real-time embedded applications now commonly contain
one million lines of code or more.
</P>
<P>
Real-time embedded systems have a complex set of characteristics that
distinguish them from other software applications.  Real-time embedded
systems are driven by and must respond to real world events while adhering to
rigorous requirements imposed by the environment with which they interact.
The correctness of the system depends not only on the results of
computations, but also on the time at which the results are produced.  The
most important and complex characteristic of real-time application systems is
that they must receive and respond to a set of external stimuli within rigid
and critical time constraints.
</P>
<P>
A single real-time application can be composed of both soft and hard
real-time components. A typical example of a hard real-time system is a
nuclear reactor control system that must not only detect failures, but must
also respond quickly enough to prevent a meltdown. This application also has
soft real-time requirements because it may involve a man-machine interface.
Providing an interactive input to the control system is not as critical as
setting off an alarm to indicate a failure condition. However, the
interactive system component must respond within an acceptable time limit to
allow the operator to interact efficiently with the control system.
