<H2>2.4: Time</H2>
<P>
The development of responsive real-time applications
requires an understanding of how RTEMS maintains and supports
time-related operations.  The basic unit of time in RTEMS is
known as a tick.  The frequency of clock ticks is completely
application dependent and determines the granularity and
accuracy of all interval and calendar time operations.
</P>
<P>
By tracking time in units of ticks, RTEMS is capable
of supporting interval timing functions such as task delays,
timeouts, timeslicing, the delayed execution of timer service
routines, and the rate monotonic scheduling of tasks.  An
interval is defined as a number of ticks relative to the current
time.  For example, when a task delays for an interval of ten
ticks, it is implied that the task will not execute until ten
clock ticks have occurred.
All intervals are specified using data type
<CODE>rtems_interval</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
A characteristic of interval timing is that the
actual interval period may be a fraction of a tick less than the
interval requested.  This occurs because the time at which the
delay timer is set up occurs at some time between two clock
ticks.  Therefore, the first countdown tick occurs in less than
the complete time interval for a tick.  This can be a problem if
the clock granularity is large.
</P>
<P>
The rate monotonic scheduling algorithm is a hard
real-time scheduling methodology.  This methodology provides
rules which allows one to guarantee that a set of independent
periodic tasks will always meet their deadlines -- even under
transient overload conditions.  The rate monotonic manager
provides directives built upon the Clock Manager's interval
timer support routines.
</P>
<P>
Interval timing is not sufficient for the many
applications which require that time be kept in wall time or
true calendar form.  Consequently, RTEMS maintains the current
date and time.  This allows selected time operations to be
scheduled at an actual calendar date and time.  For example, a
task could request to delay until midnight on New Year's Eve
before lowering the ball at Times Square.
The data type <CODE>rtems_time_of_day</CODE> is used to specify
calendar time in RTEMS services.
See <A HREF="c_user00027.html">Clock Manager Time and Date Data Structures</A>.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the directives which use intervals or wall
time cannot operate without some external mechanism which
provides a periodic clock tick.  This clock tick is typically
provided by a real time clock or counter/timer device.
