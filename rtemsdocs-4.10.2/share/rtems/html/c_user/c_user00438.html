<H2>24.1: Introduction</H2>
<P>
In multiprocessor real-time systems, new
requirements, such as sharing data and global resources between
processors, are introduced.  This requires an efficient and
reliable communications vehicle which allows all processors to
communicate with each other as necessary.  In addition, the
ramifications of multiple processors affect each and every
characteristic of a real-time system, almost always making them
more complicated.
</P>
<P>
RTEMS addresses these issues by providing simple and
flexible real-time multiprocessing capabilities.  The executive
easily lends itself to both tightly-coupled and loosely-coupled
configurations of the target system hardware.  In addition,
RTEMS supports systems composed of both homogeneous and
heterogeneous mixtures of processors and target boards.
</P>
<P>
A major design goal of the RTEMS executive was to
transcend the physical boundaries of the target hardware
configuration.  This goal is achieved by presenting the
application software with a logical view of the target system
where the boundaries between processor nodes are transparent.
As a result, the application developer may designate objects
such as tasks, queues, events, signals, semaphores, and memory
blocks as global objects.  These global objects may then be
accessed by any task regardless of the physical location of the
object and the accessing task.  RTEMS automatically determines
that the object being accessed resides on another processor and
performs the actions required to access the desired object.
Simply stated, RTEMS allows the entire system, both hardware and
software, to be viewed logically as a single system.
