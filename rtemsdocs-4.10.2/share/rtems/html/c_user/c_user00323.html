<H3>18.2.5: Dispatching Tasks</H3>
<P>
The dispatcher is the RTEMS component responsible for
allocating the processor to a ready task.  In order to allocate
the processor to one task, it must be deallocated or retrieved
from the task currently using it.  This involves a concept
called a context switch.  To perform a context switch, the
dispatcher saves the context of the current task and restores
the context of the task which has been allocated to the
processor.  Saving and restoring a task's context is the
storing/loading of all the essential information about a task to
enable it to continue execution without any effects of the
interruption.  For example, the contents of a task's register
set must be the same when it is given the processor as they were
when it was taken away.  All of the information that must be
saved or restored for a context switch is located either in the
TCB or on the task's stacks.
</P>
<P>
Tasks that utilize a numeric coprocessor and are
created with the <CODE>RTEMS_FLOATING_POINT</CODE> attribute
require additional operations during a context switch.  These
additional operations
are necessary to save and restore the floating point context of
<CODE>RTEMS_FLOATING_POINT</CODE> tasks.  To avoid unnecessary save and restore
operations, the state of the numeric coprocessor is only saved
when a <CODE>RTEMS_FLOATING_POINT</CODE> task is dispatched and that task was not
the last task to utilize the coprocessor.
