<H2>18.1: Introduction</H2>
<P>
The concept of scheduling in real-time systems
dictates the ability to provide immediate response to specific
external events, particularly the necessity of scheduling tasks
to run within a specified time limit after the occurrence of an
event.  For example, software embedded in life-support systems
used to monitor hospital patients must take instant action if a
change in the patient's status is detected.
</P>
<P>
The component of RTEMS responsible for providing this
capability is appropriately called the scheduler.  The
scheduler's sole purpose is to allocate the all important
resource of processor time to the various tasks competing for
attention.  The RTEMS scheduler allocates the processor using a
priority-based, preemptive algorithm augmented to provide
round-robin characteristics within individual priority groups.
The goal of this algorithm is to guarantee that the task which
is executing on the processor at any point in time is the one
with the highest priority among all tasks in the ready state.
</P>
<P>
There are two common methods of accomplishing the
mechanics of this algorithm.  Both ways involve a list or chain
of tasks in the ready state.  One method is to randomly place
tasks in the ready chain forcing the scheduler to scan the
entire chain to determine which task receives the processor.
The other method is to schedule the task by placing it in the
proper place on the ready chain based on the designated
scheduling criteria at the time it enters the ready state.
Thus, when the processor is free, the first task on the ready
chain is allocated the processor.  RTEMS schedules tasks using
the second method to guarantee faster response times to external
events.
