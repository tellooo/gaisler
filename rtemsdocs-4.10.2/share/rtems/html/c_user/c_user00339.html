<H4>19.2.5.6: Relaxation of Assumptions</H4>
<P>
The assumptions used to develop the RMS
schedulability rules are uncommon in most real-time systems.
For example, it was assumed that tasks have constant unvarying
execution time.  It is possible to relax this assumption, simply
by using the worst-case execution time of each task.
</P>
<P>
Another assumption is that the tasks are independent.
This means that the tasks do not wait for one another or
contend for resources.  This assumption can be relaxed by
accounting for the amount of time a task spends waiting to
acquire resources.  Similarly, each task's execution time must
account for any I/O performed and any RTEMS directive calls.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the assumptions did not account for the
time spent executing interrupt service routines.  This can be
accounted for by including all the processor utilization by
interrupt service routines in the utilization calculation.
Similarly, one should also account for the impact of delays in
accessing local memory caused by direct memory access and other
processors accessing local dual-ported memory.
</P>
<P>
The assumption that nonperiodic tasks are used only
for initialization or failure-recovery can be relaxed by placing
all periodic tasks in the critical task set.  This task set can
be scheduled and analyzed using RMS.  All nonperiodic tasks are
placed in the non-critical task set.  Although the critical task
set can be guaranteed to execute even under transient overload,
the non-critical task set is not guaranteed to execute.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the application designer must be fully
cognizant of the system and its run-time behavior when
performing schedulability analysis for a system using RMS.
Every hardware and software factor which impacts the execution
time of each task must be accounted for in the schedulability
analysis.
