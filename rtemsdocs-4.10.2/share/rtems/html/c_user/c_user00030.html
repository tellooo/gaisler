thirty-two bit integer which can be treated as a numeric
value or initialized using <CODE>rtems_build_name</CODE> to
contain four ASCII characters.

<LI><CODE>rtems_option</CODE> is the data type
used to specify which behavioral options the caller desires.
It is commonly used with potentially blocking directives to specify
whether the caller is willing to block or return immediately with an error
indicating that the resource was not available.

<LI><CODE>rtems_packet_prefix</CODE> is the data structure
that defines the first bytes in every packet sent between nodes
in an RTEMS multiprocessor system.  It contains routing information
that is expected to be used by the MPCI layer.

<LI><CODE>rtems_signal_set</CODE> is the data
type used to manage and manipulate RTEMS signal sets
with the Signal Manager.

<LI><CODE>int8_t</CODE> is the C99 data type that corresponds to signed eight
bit integers.  This data type is defined by RTEMS in a manner that
ensures it is portable across different target processors.

<LI><CODE>int16_t</CODE> is the C99 data type that corresponds to signed
sixteen bit integers.  This data type is defined by RTEMS in a manner
that ensures it is portable across different target processors.

</P>
<LI><CODE>rtems_status_codes</CODE> is the return type for most

RTEMS Task.

<LI><CODE>rtems_task_argument</CODE> is the data
type for the argument passed to each RTEMS task. In RTEMS 4.7

entry point of the function implementing the TSR.

<LI><CODE>rtems_vector_number</CODE> is the data
type used to manage and manipulate interrupt vector numbers.

<LI><CODE>uint8_t</CODE> is the C99 data type that corresponds to unsigned
eight bit integers.  This data type is defined by RTEMS in a manner that
ensures it is portable across different target processors.

<LI><CODE>uint16_t</CODE> is the C99 data type that corresponds to unsigned
sixteen bit integers.  This data type is defined by RTEMS in a manner
that ensures it is portable across different target processors.

<LI><CODE>uint32_t</CODE> is the C99 data type that corresponds to unsigned
thirty-two bit integers.  This data type is defined by RTEMS in a manner
that ensures it is portable across different target processors.

<LI><CODE>uint64_t</CODE> is the C99 data type that corresponds to unsigned
sixty-four bit integers.  This data type is defined by RTEMS in a manner
that ensures it is portable across different target processors.

<LI><CODE>uintptr_t</CODE> is the C99 data type that corresponds to the
unsigned integer type that is of sufficient size to represent addresses
as unsigned integers.  This data type is defined by RTEMS in a manner
that ensures it is portable across different target processors.
