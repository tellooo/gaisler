<H3>22.2.1: Extension Sets</H3>
<P>
An extension set is defined as a set of routines
which are invoked at each of the critical system events at which
user extension routines are invoked.  Together a set of these
routines typically perform a specific functionality such as
performance monitoring or debugger support.  RTEMS is informed of
the entry points which constitute an extension set via the
following structure:
</P>
<DL><DT><DD>
<PRE>
typedef struct {
  rtems_task_create_extension      thread_create;
  rtems_task_start_extension       thread_start;
  rtems_task_restart_extension     thread_restart;
  rtems_task_delete_extension      thread_delete;
  rtems_task_switch_extension      thread_switch;
  rtems_task_begin_extension       thread_begin;
  rtems_task_exitted_extension     thread_exitted;
  rtems_fatal_extension            fatal;
} rtems_extensions_table;
</PRE>
</DL>
<P>
RTEMS allows the user to have multiple extension sets
active at the same time.  First, a single static extension set
may be defined as the application's User Extension Table which
is included as part of the Configuration Table.  This extension
set is active for the entire life of the system and may not be
deleted.  This extension set is especially important because it
is the only way the application can provided a FATAL error
extension which is invoked if RTEMS fails during the
initialize_executive directive.  The static extension set is
optional and may be configured as NULL if no static extension
set is required.
</P>
<P>
Second, the user can install dynamic extensions using
the <CODE>rtems_extension_create</CODE>
directive.  These extensions are RTEMS
objects in that they have a name, an ID, and can be dynamically
created and deleted.  In contrast to the static extension set,
these extensions can only be created and installed after the
initialize_executive directive successfully completes execution.
Dynamic extensions are useful for encapsulating the
functionality of an extension set.  For example, the application
could use extensions to manage a special coprocessor, do
performance monitoring, and to do stack bounds checking.  Each
of these extension sets could be written and installed
independently of the others.
</P>
<P>
All user extensions are optional and RTEMS places no
naming  restrictions on the user. The user extension entry points
are copied into an internal RTEMS structure. This means the user
does not need to keep the table after creating it, and changing the
handler entry points dynamically in a table once created has no
effect. Creating a table local to a function can save space in
space limited applications.
</P>
<P>
Extension switches do not effect the context switch overhead if
no switch handler is installed.
