<H2>23.12: Determining Memory Requirements</H2>
<P>
Since memory is a critical resource in many real-time
embedded systems, the RTEMS Classic API was specifically designed to allow
unused managers to be forcibly excluded from the run-time environment.
This allows the application designer the flexibility to tailor
RTEMS to most efficiently meet system requirements while still
satisfying even the most stringent memory constraints.  As
result, the size of the RTEMS executive is application
dependent.
</P>
<P>
It is not necessary for RTEMS Application Developers to calculate
the amount of memory required for the RTEMS Workspace.  This
is done automatically by <CODE>&lt;rtems/confdefs.h&gt;</CODE>.
See <A HREF="ada_user00424.html">Configuring a System Sizing the RTEMS RAM Workspace</A> for
more details on how
this works.  In the event, you are interested in the memory required
for an instance of a particular RTEMS object, please run the test
<CODE>spsize</CODE> on your target board.
</P>
<P>
RTEMS is built to be a library and any routines that you do not
directly or indirectly require in your application will <STRONG>NOT</STRONG>
be included in your executable image.  However, some managers
may be explicitly excluded and no attempt to create these instances
of these objects will succeed even if they are configured.
The following Classic API managers may be optionally excluded:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>signal
<LI>region
<LI>dual ported memory
<LI>event
<LI>multiprocessing
<LI>partition
<LI>timer
<LI>semaphore
<LI>message
<LI>rate monotonic
</UL>

<P>
RTEMS is designed to be built and installed as a library
that is linked into the application.  As such, much of
RTEMS is implemented in such a way that there is a single
entry point per source file.  This avoids having the
linker being forced to pull large object files in their
entirety into an application when the application references
a single symbol.  In the event you discover an RTEMS method
that is included in your executable but never entered, please
let us know.  It might be an opportunity to break a dependency
and shrink many RTEMS applications.
</P>
<P>
RTEMS based applications must somehow provide memory
for RTEMS' code and data space.  Although RTEMS' data space must
be in RAM, its code space can be located in either ROM or RAM.
In addition, the user must allocate RAM for the RTEMS RAM
Workspace.  The size of this area is application dependent and
can be calculated using the formula provided in the Memory
Requirements chapter of the Applications Supplement document
for a specific target processor.
</P>
<P>
All private RTEMS data variables and routine names used by
RTEMS begin with the underscore ( _ ) character followed by an
upper-case letter.  If RTEMS is linked with an application, then
the application code should NOT contain any symbols which begin
with the underscore character and followed by an upper-case
letter to avoid any naming conflicts.  All RTEMS directive names
should be treated as reserved words.
