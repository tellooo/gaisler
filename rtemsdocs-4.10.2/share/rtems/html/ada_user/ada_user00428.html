<H3>23.2.4: Device Driver Table</H3>
<P>
This section defines the configuration parameters related
to the automatic generation of a Device Driver Table.  As
<CODE>rtems/confdefs.h</CODE> only is aware of a small set of
standard device drivers, the generated Device Driver
Table is suitable for simple applications with no
custom device drivers.
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_HAS_OWN_DEVICE_DRIVER_TABLE</CODE> is defined if
the application wishes to provide their own Device Driver Table.
The table generated is an array of <CODE>rtems_driver_address_table</CODE>
entries named <CODE>Device_drivers</CODE>.  By default, this is not
defined indicating the <CODE>rtems/confdefs.h</CODE> is providing the
device driver table.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_DRIVERS</CODE> is defined
as the number of device drivers per node.  By default, this is
set to 10.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_DEVICES</CODE> is defined
to the number of individual devices that may be registered
in the system.  By default, this is set to 4.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CONSOLE_DRIVER</CODE>
is defined
if the application wishes to include the Console Device Driver.
This device driver is responsible for providing standard input
and output using &quot;/dev/console&quot;.  By default, this is not
defined.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CLOCK_DRIVER</CODE>
is defined
if the application wishes to include the Clock Device Driver.
This device driver is responsible for providing a regular
interrupt which invokes the <CODE>rtems_clock_tick</CODE> directive.
By default, this is not defined.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_TIMER_DRIVER</CODE>
is defined if the application wishes to include the Timer Driver.
This device driver is used to benchmark execution times
by the RTEMS Timing Test Suites.  By default, this is not
defined.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_DOES_NOT_NEED_CLOCK_DRIVER</CODE> is defined
when the application does <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> want the Clock Device Driver
and is <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> using the Timer Driver.  The inclusion or
exclusion of the Clock Driver must be explicit in typical
user applications.  This is intended to prevent the common
user error of using the Hello World example as the baseline
for an application and leaving out a clock tick source.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_RTC_DRIVER</CODE>
is defined if the application wishes to include the Real-Time Clock Driver.
By default, this is not defined.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_WATCHDOG_DRIVER</CODE>
is defined if the application wishes to include the Watchdog Driver.
By default, this is not defined.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_FRAME_BUFFER_DRIVER</CODE>
is defined
if the application wishes to include the BSP's Frame Buffer Device Driver.
Most BSPs do not provide a Frame Buffer Device Driver.  If this is
defined and the BSP does not have this device driver, then the user
will get a link time error for an undefined symbol.
By default, this is not defined.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_STUB_DRIVER</CODE>
is defined if the application wishes to include the Stub Device Driver.
This device driver simply provides entry points that return
successful and is primarily a test fixture.
By default, this is not defined.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_BSP_PREREQUISITE_DRIVERS</CODE> is defined if the
BSP has device drivers it needs to include in the Device Driver
Table.  This should be defined to the set of device driver entries that
will be placed in the table at the <STRONG>FRONT</STRONG> of the Device Driver Table
and initialized before any other drivers <STRONG>INCLUDING</STRONG> any application
prerequisite drivers.  By default,this is not defined.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_PREREQUISITE_DRIVERS</CODE> is defined if the
application has device drivers it needs to include in the Device Driver
Table.  This should be defined to the set of device driver entries that
will be placed in the table at the <STRONG>FRONT</STRONG> of the Device Driver Table
and initialized before any other drivers <STRONG>EXCEPT</STRONG> any BSP prerequisite
drivers.  By default,this is not defined.

<LI><CODE>CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_EXTRA_DRIVERS</CODE> is defined if the
application has device drivers it needs to include in the Device Driver
Table.  This should be defined to the set of device driver entries that
will be placed in the table at the <STRONG>END</STRONG> of the Device Driver Table.
By default,this is not defined.
