<P>
An RTEMS based application is initiated or
re-initiated when the processor is reset.  This initialization
code is responsible for preparing the target platform for the
RTEMS application.  Although the exact actions performed by the
initialization code are highly processor and target dependent,
the logical functionality of these actions are similar across a
variety of processors and target platforms.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the BSP and some of the application initialization is
intertwined in the RTEMS initialization sequence controlled by
the shared function <CODE>boot_card()</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
The reset application initialization code is executed
first when the processor is reset.  All of the hardware must be
initialized to a quiescent state by this software before
initializing RTEMS.  When in quiescent state, devices do not
generate any interrupts or require any servicing by the
application.  Some of the hardware components may be initialized
in this code as well as any application initialization that does
not involve calls to RTEMS directives.
</P>
<P>
The processor's Interrupt Vector Table which will be used by the
application may need to be set to the required value by the reset
application initialization code.  Because interrupts are enabled
automatically by RTEMS as part of the context switch to the first task,
the Interrupt Vector Table MUST be set before this directive is invoked
to ensure correct interrupt vectoring.  The processor's Interrupt Vector
Table must be accessible by RTEMS as it will be modified by the when
installing user Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) On some CPUs, RTEMS
installs it's own Interrupt Vector Table as part of initialization and
thus these requirements are met automatically.  The reset code which is
executed before the call to any RTEMS initialization routines has the
following requirements:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Must not make any blocking RTEMS directive calls.

<LI>If the processor supports multiple privilege levels, must leave
the processor in the most privileged, or supervisory, state.

<LI>Must allocate a stack of sufficient size to execute the initialization
and shutdown of the system.  This stack area will NOT be used by any task
once the system is initialized.  This stack is often reserved via the
linker script or in the assembly language start up file.

<LI>Must initialize the stack pointer for the initialization process to
that allocated.

<LI>Must initialize the processor's Interrupt Vector Table.

<LI>Must disable all maskable interrupts.

<LI>If the processor supports a separate interrupt stack, must allocate
the interrupt stack and initialize the interrupt stack pointer.

</UL>
<P>
At the end of the initialization sequence, RTEMS does not return to the
BSP initialization code, but instead context switches to the highest
priority task to begin application execution.  This task is typically
a User Initialization Task which is responsible for performing both
local and global application initialization which is dependent on RTEMS
facilities.  It is also responsible for initializing any higher level
RTEMS services the application uses such as networking and blocking
device drivers.
