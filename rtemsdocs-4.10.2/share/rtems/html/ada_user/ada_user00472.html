<P>
When analyzing and debugging real-time applications, it is important
to be able to know how much CPU time each task in the system consumes.
This support component provides a mechanism to easily obtain this
information with little burden placed on the target.
</P>
<P>
The raw data is gathered as part of performing a context switch.  RTEMS
keeps track of how many clock ticks have occurred which the task being
switched out has been executing.  If the task has been running less than
1 clock tick, then for the purposes of the statistics, it is assumed to
have executed 1 clock tick.  This results in some inaccuracy but the
alternative is for the task to have appeared to execute 0 clock ticks.
</P>
<P>
RTEMS versions newer than the 4.7 release series, support the ability
to obtain timestamps with nanosecond granularity if the BSP provides
support.  It is a desirable enhancement to change the way the usage
data is gathered to take advantage of this recently added capability.
Please consider sponsoring the core RTEMS development team to add
this capability.
