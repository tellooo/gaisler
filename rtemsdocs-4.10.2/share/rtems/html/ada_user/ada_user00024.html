<H3>2.2.3: Object ID Description</H3>
<P>
The components of an object ID make it possible
to quickly locate any object in even the most complicated
multiprocessor system.  Object ID's are associated with an
object by RTEMS when the object is created and the corresponding
ID is returned by the appropriate object create directive.  The
object ID is required as input to all directives involving
objects, except those which create an object or obtain the ID of
an object.
</P>
<P>
The object identification directives can be used to
dynamically obtain a particular object's ID given its name.
This mapping is accomplished by searching the name table
associated with this object type.  If the name is non-unique,
then the ID associated with the first occurrence of the name
will be returned to the application.  Since object IDs are
returned when the object is created, the object identification
directives are not necessary in a properly designed single
processor application.
</P>
<P>
In addition, services are provided to portably examine the
subcomponents of an RTEMS ID.  These services are
described in detail later in this manual but are prototyped
as follows:
</P>
<DL><DT><DD>
<PRE>
uint32_t rtems_object_id_get_api( rtems_id );
uint32_t rtems_object_id_get_class( rtems_id );
uint32_t rtems_object_id_get_node( rtems_id );
uint32_t rtems_object_id_get_index( rtems_id );
</PRE>
</DL>
<P>
An object control block is a data structure defined
by RTEMS which contains the information necessary to manage a
particular object type.  For efficiency reasons, the format of
each object type's control block is different.  However, many of
the fields are similar in function.  The number of each type of
control block is application dependent and determined by the
values specified in the user's Configuration Table.  An object
control block is allocated at object create time and freed when
the object is deleted.  With the exception of user extension
routines, object control blocks are not directly manipulated by
user applications.
