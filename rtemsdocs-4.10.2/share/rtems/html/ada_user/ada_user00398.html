<H3>22.2.4: Order of Invocation</H3>
<P>
When one of the critical system events occur, the
user extensions are invoked in either &quot;forward&quot; or &quot;reverse&quot;
order.  Forward order indicates that the static extension set is
invoked followed by the dynamic extension sets in the order in
which they were created.  Reverse order means that the dynamic
extension sets are invoked in the opposite of the order in which
they were created followed by the static extension set.  By
invoking the extension sets in this order, extensions can be
built upon one another.  At the following system events, the
extensions are invoked in forward order:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Task creation
<LI>Task initiation
<LI>Task reinitiation
<LI>Task deletion
<LI>Task context switch
<LI>Post task context switch
<LI>Task begins to execute
</UL>

<P>
At the following system events, the extensions are
invoked in reverse order:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Task deletion
<LI>Fatal error detection
</UL>

<P>
At these system events, the extensions are invoked in
reverse order to insure that if an extension set is built upon
another, the more complicated extension is invoked before the
extension set it is built upon.  For example, by invoking the
static extension set last it is known that the &quot;system&quot; fatal
error extension will be the last fatal error extension executed.
Another example is use of the task delete extension by the
Standard C Library.  Extension sets which are installed after
the Standard C Library will operate correctly even if they
utilize the C Library because the C Library's TASK_DELETE
extension is invoked after that of the other extensions.
