<H3>19.2.4: Rate Monotonic Scheduling Algorithm</H3>
<P>
The Rate Monotonic Scheduling Algorithm (RMS) is
important to real-time systems designers because it allows one
to guarantee that a set of tasks is schedulable.  A set of tasks
is said to be schedulable if all of the tasks can meet their
deadlines.  RMS provides a set of rules which can be used to
perform a guaranteed schedulability analysis for a task set.
This analysis determines whether a task set is schedulable under
worst-case conditions and emphasizes the predictability of the
system's behavior.  It has been proven that:
</P>
<UL>
<P>
<STRONG>RMS is an optimal static priority algorithm for scheduling independent, preemptible, periodic tasks on a single processor.</STRONG>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
RMS is optimal in the sense that if a set of tasks
can be scheduled by any static priority algorithm, then RMS will
be able to schedule that task set.  RMS bases it schedulability
analysis on the processor utilization level below which all
deadlines can be met.
</P>
<P>
RMS calls for the static assignment of task
priorities based upon their period.  The shorter a task's
period, the higher its priority.  For example, a task with a 1
millisecond period has higher priority than a task with a 100
millisecond period.  If two tasks have the same period, then RMS
does not distinguish between the tasks.  However, RTEMS
specifies that when given tasks of equal priority, the task
which has been ready longest will execute first.  RMS's priority
assignment scheme does not provide one with exact numeric values
for task priorities.  For example, consider the following task
set and priority assignments:
</P>
<CENTER>
  <TABLE COLS=3 WIDTH="80%" BORDER=2>
<TR><TD ALIGN=center><STRONG>Task</STRONG></TD>
    <TD ALIGN=center><STRONG>Period (in milliseconds)</STRONG></TD>
    <TD ALIGN=center><STRONG>Priority</STRONG></TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=center>1</TD>
    <TD ALIGN=center>100 </TD>
    <TD ALIGN=center>Low</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=center>2</TD>
    <TD ALIGN=center>50 </TD>
    <TD ALIGN=center>Medium</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=center>3</TD>
    <TD ALIGN=center>50 </TD>
    <TD ALIGN=center>Medium</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=center>4</TD>
    <TD ALIGN=center>25 </TD>
    <TD ALIGN=center>High</TD></TR>
  </TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
RMS only calls for task 1 to have the lowest
priority, task 4 to have the highest priority, and tasks 2 and 3
to have an equal priority between that of tasks 1 and 4.  The
actual RTEMS priorities assigned to the tasks must only adhere
to those guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Many applications have tasks with both hard and soft
deadlines.  The tasks with hard deadlines are typically referred
to as the critical task set, with the soft deadline tasks being
the non-critical task set.  The critical task set can be
scheduled using RMS, with the non-critical tasks not executing
under transient overload, by simply assigning priorities such
that the lowest priority critical task (i.e. longest period) has
a higher priority than the highest priority non-critical task.
Although RMS may be used to assign priorities to the
non-critical tasks, it is not necessary.  In this instance,
schedulability is only guaranteed for the critical task set.
