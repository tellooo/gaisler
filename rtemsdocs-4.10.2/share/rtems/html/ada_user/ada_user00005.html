<H2>1.2: Real-time Application Systems</H2>
<P>
Real-time application systems are a special class of
computer applications.  They have a complex set of
characteristics that distinguish them from other software
problems.  Generally, they must adhere to more rigorous
requirements.  The correctness of the system depends not only on
the results of computations, but also on the time at which the
results are produced.  The most important and complex
characteristic of real-time application systems is that they
must receive and respond to a set of external stimuli within
rigid and critical time constraints referred to as deadlines.
Systems can be buried by an avalanche of interdependent,
asynchronous or cyclical event streams.
</P>
<P>
Deadlines can be further characterized as either hard
or soft based upon the value of the results when produced after
the deadline has passed.  A deadline is hard if the results have
no value or if their use will result in a catastrophic event.
In contrast, results which are produced after a soft deadline
may have some value.
</P>
<P>
Another distinguishing requirement of real-time
application systems is the ability to coordinate or manage a
large number of concurrent activities. Since software is a
synchronous entity, this presents special problems.  One
instruction follows another in a repeating synchronous cycle.
Even though mechanisms have been developed to allow for the
processing of external asynchronous events, the software design
efforts required to process and manage these events and tasks
are growing more complicated.
</P>
<P>
The design process is complicated further by
spreading this activity over a set of processors instead of a
single processor. The challenges associated with designing and
building real-time application systems become very complex when
multiple processors are involved.  New requirements such as
interprocessor communication channels and global resources that
must be shared between competing processors are introduced.  The
ramifications of multiple processors complicate each and every
characteristic of a real-time system.
