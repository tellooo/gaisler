<H3>11.2.1: Event Sets</H3>
<P>
An event flag is used by a task (or ISR) to inform
another task of the occurrence of a significant situation.
Thirty-two event flags are associated with each task.  A
collection of one or more event flags is referred to as an event
set.  The data type <CODE>rtems.event_set</CODE> is used to manage
event sets.
</P>
<P>
The application developer should remember the following
key characteristics of event operations when utilizing the event
manager:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Events provide a simple synchronization facility.

<LI>Events are aimed at tasks.

<LI>Tasks can wait on more than one event simultaneously.

<LI>Events are independent of one another.

<LI>Events do not hold or transport data.

<LI>Events are not queued.  In other words, if an event is
sent more than once to a task before being received, the second and
subsequent send operations to that same task have no effect.
</UL>

<P>
An event set is posted when it is directed (or sent) to a task.  A
pending event is an event that has been posted but not received.  An event
condition is used to specify the event set which the task desires to receive
and the algorithm which will be used to determine when the request is
satisfied. An event condition is satisfied based upon one of two
algorithms which are selected by the user.  The
<CODE>RTEMS.EVENT_ANY</CODE> algorithm states that an event condition
is satisfied when at least a single requested event is posted.  The
<CODE>RTEMS.EVENT_ALL</CODE> algorithm states that an event condition
is satisfied when every requested event is posted.
