<H3>19.2.2: Period Statistics</H3>
<P>
This manager maintains a set of statistics on each period.  These
statistics are reset implictly at period creation time and may be
reset or obtained at any time by the application.  The following
is a list of the information kept:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>owner</CODE>
is the id of the thread that owns this period.

<LI><CODE>count</CODE>
is the total number of periods executed.

<LI><CODE>missed_count</CODE>
is the number of periods that were missed.

<LI><CODE>min_cpu_time</CODE>
is the minimum amount of CPU execution time consumed
on any execution of the periodic loop.

<LI><CODE>max_cpu_time</CODE>
is the maximum amount of CPU execution time consumed
on any execution of the periodic loop.

<LI><CODE>total_cpu_time</CODE>
is the total amount of CPU execution time consumed
by executions of the periodic loop.

<LI><CODE>min_wall_time</CODE>
is the minimum amount of wall time that passed
on any execution of the periodic loop.

<LI><CODE>max_wall_time</CODE>
is the maximum amount of wall time that passed
on any execution of the periodic loop.

<LI><CODE>total_wall_time</CODE>
is the total amount of wall time that passed
during executions of the periodic loop.

</UL>
<P>
The period statistics information is inexpensive to maintain
and can provide very useful insights into the execution
characteristics of a periodic task loop.  But it is just information.
The period statistics reported must be analyzed by the user in terms
of what the applications is.  For example, in an application where
priorities are assigned by the Rate Monotonic Algorithm, it would
be very undesirable for high priority (i.e. frequency) tasks to
miss their period.  Similarly, in nearly any application, if a
task were supposed to execute its periodic loop every 10 milliseconds
and it averaged 11 milliseconds, then application requirements
are not being met.
</P>
<P>
The information reported can be used to determine the &quot;hot spots&quot;
in the application.  Given a period's id, the user can determine
the length of that period.  From that information and the CPU usage,
the user can calculate the percentage of CPU time consumed by that
periodic task.  For example, a task executing for 20 milliseconds
every 200 milliseconds is consuming 10 percent of the processor's
execution time.  This is usually enough to make it a good candidate
for optimization.
</P>
<P>
However, execution time alone is not enough to gauge the value of
optimizing a particular task.  It is more important to optimize
a task executing 2 millisecond every 10 milliseconds (20 percent
of the CPU) than one executing 10 milliseconds every 100 (10 percent
of the CPU).  As a general rule of thumb, the higher frequency at
which a task executes, the more important it is to optimize that
task.
