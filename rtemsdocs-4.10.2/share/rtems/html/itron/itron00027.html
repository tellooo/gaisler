<H3>1.4.11: rel_wai - Release Wait of Other Task</H3>
<H3>CALLING SEQUENCE:</H3>
<DL><DT><DD>
<PRE>
ER rel_wai(
  ID tskid
);
</PRE>
</DL>
<H3>STATUS CODES:</H3>
<P>
<CODE>E_OK</CODE> - Normal Completion
</P>
<P>
<CODE>E_ID</CODE> - Invalid ID Number (tskid was invalid or could not be used)
</P>
<P>
<CODE>E_NOEXS</CODE> - Object does not exist (the task specified by tskid does not exist)
</P>
<P>
<CODE>E_OACV</CODE> - Object access violation (A tskid less than -4 was specified from a user task.  This is implementation dependent.)
</P>
<P>
<CODE>E_OBJ</CODE> - Invalid object state (the target task is not in WAIT state (including when it is in DORMANT state or when the issuing task specifies itself))
</P>
<P>
<CODE>EN_OBJNO</CODE> - An object number which could not be accessed on the target node is specified.
</P>
<P>
<CODE>EN_CTXID</CODE> - Specified an object on another node when the system call was issued from a task in dispatch disabled state or from a task-independent portion
</P>
<H3>DESCRIPTION:</H3>
<P>
This system call forcibly releases WAIT state (not including SUSPEND state)
of the task specified by tskid.
</P>
<P>
An E_RLWAI error is returned to the task whose WAIT state has been released using rel_wai.
</P>
<P>
Wait release requests by rel_wai are not queued.  In other words, if the task specified by tskid is already in WAIT state, the WAIT state is released, otherwise an E_OBJ error will be returned to the issuer.  An E_OBJ error will also result when a task specifies itself to this system call.
</P>
<P>
Rel_wai does not release SUSPEND state.  If rel_wai is issued on a task in WAIT-SUSPEND state, WAIT will be released but SUSPEND will continue for that task. When SUSPEND should also be released, the frsm_tsk system call must be issued separately.
</P>
<H3>NOTES:</H3>
<P>
A function similar to timeout can be implemented using an alarm handler which issues this system call on tasks specified time after they have entered WAIT state.
</P>
<P>
Rel_wai and wup_tsk differ in the following points.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Wup_tsk can only release the WAIT state by slp_tsk or tslp_tsk, while rel_wai can release WAIT states caused by these and other calls (including wai_flg, wai_sem, rcv_msg, get_blk, etc.).
<LI>As seen from the target task, releasing WAIT state with wup_tsk results in a normal completion (E_OK), whereas releasing WAIT state with rel_wai results in an error (E_RLWAI).
<LI>When wup_tsk is used, a request is queued even if neither slp_tsk nor tslp_tsk have been executed on the target task yet.  When rel_wai is used to the task which is not in WAIT state, an E_OBJ error will result.
</UL>
