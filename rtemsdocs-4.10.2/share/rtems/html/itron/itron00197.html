<H2>14.1: Introduction</H2>
<P>
This chapter describes the status of the implementation of each
manager in the RTEMS implementataion of the uITRON 3.0 API.   The
status of each manager is presented in terms of documentation and
status relative to the extended level (level 'E') of the uITRON 3.0
API specification.  The extended level of the specification is
the level at which dynamic object creation, deletion, and
reference services are available.  This level is more akin to the other
APIs supported by RTEMS.  This purpose of this chapter is
to make it clear what is required to bring the RTEMS
uITRON API implementation into compliance with the
specification.  The following description of the specification
levels is taken from the uITRON 3.0 API specification.
</P>
<P>
uITRON 3.0 specification is divided into fewer system call levels than was the
previous uITRON 2.0 specification.  There are now just three levels: Level R
(Required), Level S (Standard) and Level E (Extended).  In addition to these
three levels, there is also Level C for CPU-dependent system calls.
In addition, the uITRON 3.0 API, defines the network level ('N') which
represents system calls that support the connection function
</P>
<UL>
<LI>[level R] (Required)
The functions in this level are mandatory for all implementations of
uITRON 3.0 specification.  This includes basic functions for achieving
a real-time, multitasking OS.  These functions can be implemented even
without a hardware timer.  This level corresponds to Levels 1 and 2
of uITRON 2.0 specification.

<LI>[level S] (Standard)
This includes basic functions for achieving a real-time, multitasking
OS.  This level corresponds to Levels 3 and 4 of uITRON 2.0
specification.

<LI>[level E] (Extended)
This includes additional and extended functions.  This corresponds to
functions not included in uITRON 2.0 specification (functions of
ITRON2 specification).  Specifically, this level includes object
creation and deletion functions, rendezvous functions, memorypools
and the timer handler.

<LI>[level C] (CPU dependent)
This level provides implementation-dependent functions required due to
the CPU or hardware configuration.

</UL>
<P>
The support level of the connection function is indicated by appending an 'N'
to the end of the level.  For example, connectivity supported at [level S]
would be referred to as [level SN].  The support level for functions which
can only send requests for operations on other nodes but offer no system call
processing on the issuing node itself are indicated by the lower case letter
's' or 'e'.
