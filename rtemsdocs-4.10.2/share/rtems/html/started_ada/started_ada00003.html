<H2>1.2: Cross Development</H2>
<P>
Today almost all real-time embedded software systems are developed in a
<STRONG>cross development</STRONG> environment using cross development tools. In the cross
development environment, software development activities are typically
performed on one computer system, the <STRONG>host</STRONG> system, while the result of the
development effort (produced by the cross tools) is a software system that
executes on the <STRONG>target</STRONG> platform. The requirements for the target platform are
usually incompatible and quite often in direct conflict with the requirements
for the host.  Moreover, the target hardware is often custom designed for a
particular project.  This means that the cross development toolset must allow
the developer to customize the tools to address target specific run-time
issues.  The toolset must have provisions for board dependent initialization
code, device drivers, and error handling code.
</P>
<P>
The host computer is optimized to support the code development cycle with
support for code editors, compilers, and linkers requiring large disk drives,
user development windows, and multiple developer connections.  Thus the host
computer is typically a traditional UNIX workstation such as are available
from SUN or Silicon Graphics, or a PC running either a version of MS-Windows
or UNIX.  The host system may also be required to execute office productivity
applications to allow the software developer to write  documentation, make
presentations, or track the project's progress using a project management
tool.  This necessitates that the host computer be general purpose with
resources such as a thirty-two or sixty-four bit processor, large amounts of
RAM, a  monitor, mouse, keyboard, hard and floppy disk drives, CD-ROM drive,
and a graphics card.  It is likely that the system will be multimedia capable
and have some networking capability.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the target platform generally has limited traditional computer
resources.  The hardware is designed for the particular functionality and
requirements of the embedded system and optimized to perform those tasks
effectively.  Instead of hard  driverss and keyboards, it is composed of
sensors, relays, and stepper motors. The per-unit cost of the target platform
is typically a critical concern.  No hardware component is included without
being cost justified.  As a result, the processor of the target system is
often from a different processor family than that of the host system and
usually has lower performance.  In addition to the processor families
targeted only for use in embedded systems, there are versions of nearly every
general-purpose process or specifically tailored for real-time embedded
systems.  For example, many of the processors targeting the embedded market
do not include hardware floating point units, but do include peripherals such
as timers, serial controllers, or network interfaces.
