<H3>2.1.1: Base Filesystem Mounting</H3>
<P>
At present, the first file system to be mounted is the `In Memory File
System'. It is mounted using a standard MOUNT() command in which the mount
point is NULL.  This flags the mount as the first file system to be
registered under the operating system and appropriate initialization of file
system management information is performed (See figures 4 and 5). If a
different file system type is desired as the base file system, alterations
must be made to base_fs.c. This routine handles the mount of the base file
system.

Once the root of the base file system has been established and it has been
recorded as the mount point of the base file system, devices are integrated
into the base file system. For every device that is configured into the
system (See ioman.c) a device registration process is performed. Device
registration produces a unique dev_t handle that consists of a major and
minor device number. In addition, the configuration information for each
device contains a text string that represents the fully qualified pathname to
that device's place in the base file system's hierarchy. A file system node
is created for the device along the specified registration path.

Note: Other file systems can be mounted but they are mounted onto points
(directory mount points) in the base file system.
