<H2>2.4: Questions to Ask</H2>
<P>
When evaluating what is required to support RTEMS applications on
a particular target board, the following questions should be asked:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Does a BSP for this board exist?

<LI>Does a BSP for a similar board exists?

<LI>Is the board's CPU supported?

</UL>
<P>
If there is already a BSP for the board, then things may already be ready
to start developing application software.  All that remains is to verify
that the existing BSP provides device drivers for all the peripherals
on the board that the application will be using.  For example, the application
in question may require that the board's Ethernet controller be used and
the existing BSP may not support this.
</P>
<P>
If the BSP does not exist and the board's CPU model is supported, then
examine the reusable chip library and existing BSPs for a close match.
Other BSPs and libchip provide starting points for the development
of a new BSP.  It is often possible to copy existing components in
the reusable chip library or device drivers from BSPs from different
CPU families as the starting point for a new device driver.
This will help reduce the development effort required.
</P>
<P>
If the board's CPU family is supported but the particular CPU model on
that board is not, then the RTEMS port to that CPU family will have to
be augmented.  After this is done, development of the new BSP can proceed.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise both CPU dependent code and the BSP will have to be written.
</P>
<P>
This type of development often requires specialized skills.  If
you need help in making these modifications to RTEMS, please
consider using one of the RTEMS Service Providers.  The current
list of these is at <A HREF="http://www.rtems.com/support.html"></A>.
