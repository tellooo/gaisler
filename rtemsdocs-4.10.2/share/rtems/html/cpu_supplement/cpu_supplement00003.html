Microprocessors are generally classified into families with a variety of
CPU models or implementations within that family.  Within a processor
family, there is a high level of binary compatibility.  This family
may be based on either an architectural specification or on maintaining
compatibility with a popular processor.  Recent microprocessor families
such as the SPARC or PowerPC are based on an architectural specification
which is independent or any particular CPU model or implementation.
Older families such as the Motorola 68000 and the Intel x86 evolved as the
manufacturer strived to produce higher performance processor models which
maintained binary compatibility with older models.

<P>
RTEMS takes advantage of the similarity of the various models within a
CPU family.  Although the models do vary in significant ways, the high
level of compatibility makes it possible to share the bulk of the CPU
dependent executive code across the entire family.  Each processor family
supported by RTEMS has a list of features which vary between CPU models
within a family.  For example, the most common model dependent feature
regardless of CPU family is the presence or absence of a floating point
unit or coprocessor.  When defining the list of features present on a
particular CPU model, one simply notes that floating point hardware
is or is not present and defines a single constant appropriately.
Conditional compilation is utilized to include the appropriate source
code for this CPU model's feature set.  It is important to note that
this means that RTEMS is thus compiled using the appropriate feature set
and compilation flags optimal for this CPU model used.  The alternative
would be to generate a binary which would execute on all family members
using only the features which were always present.
</P>
<P>
The set of CPU model feature macros are defined in the file
<CODE>cpukit/score/cpu/CPU/rtems/score/cpu.h</CODE> based upon the GNU tools
multilib variant that is appropriate for the particular CPU model defined
on the compilation command line.
</P>
<P>
In each of the architecture specific chapters, this section presents
the set of features which vary across various implementations of the
architecture that may be of importance to RTEMS application developers.
</P>
<P>
The subsections will vary amongst the target architecture chapters as
the specific features may vary.  However, each port will include a few
common features such as the CPU Model Name and presence of a hardware
Floating Point Unit.  The common features are described here.
