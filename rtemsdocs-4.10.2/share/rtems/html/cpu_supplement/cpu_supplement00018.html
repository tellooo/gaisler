<H3>1.4.3: Disabling of Interrupts by RTEMS</H3>
<P>
During the execution of directive calls, critical sections of code may
be executed.  When these sections are encountered, RTEMS disables all
external interrupts before the execution of this section and restores
them to the previous level upon completion of the section.  RTEMS has
been optimized to ensure that interrupts are disabled for the shortest
number of instructions possible.  Since the precise number of instructions
and their execution time varies based upon target CPU family, CPU model,
board memory speed, compiler version, and optimization level, it is
not practical to provide the precise number for all possible RTEMS
configurations.
</P>
<P>
Historically, the measurements were made by hand analyzing and counting
the execution time of instruction sequences during interrupt disable
critical sections.  For reference purposes, on a 16 Mhz Motorola
MC68020, the maximum interrupt disable period was typically approximately
ten (10) to thirteen (13) microseconds.  This architecture was memory bound
and had a slow bit scan instruction.  In contrast, during the same
period a 14 Mhz SPARC would have a worst case disable time of approximately
two (2) to three (3) microseconds because it had a single cycle bit scan
instruction and used fewer cycles for memory accesses.
</P>
<P>
If you are interested in knowing the worst case execution time for
a particular version of RTEMS, please contact OAR Corporation and
we will be happy to product the results as a consulting service.
</P>
<P>
Non-maskable interrupts (NMI) cannot be disabled, and
ISRs which execute at this level MUST NEVER issue RTEMS system
calls.  If a directive is invoked, unpredictable results may
occur due to the inability of RTEMS to protect its critical
sections.  However, ISRs that make no system calls may safely
execute as non-maskable interrupts.
