This directory contains a SpaceWire RTEMS test/example application used
together with the GRSPW Router.

The Makefile is used to build the example "make all". To build NGMP specific tests, then enter "make CPU=ngmp all".

When building the examples it is possible to control the behaviour by setting the following variables.

CPU         - By setting the CPU variable to one of the cpu-targets, then the hardware specific flags for that cpu-target will be added when compiling.
CFLAGS      - Override common compilation flags
CPUFLAGS    - Override the hardware specific compilation flags
MKPROMFLAGS - Override mkprom2 flags

REQUIREMENTS
============
 RCC-1.2.4 or later.
