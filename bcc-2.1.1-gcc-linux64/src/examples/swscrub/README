This is an example on how to read blocks of RAM and rewriting when a
correctable error is detected.

The example demonstrates how the AHBSTAT can be used to monitor and detect
errors and also how a memory location can be rewritten to RAM in a safe
(atomic) way.

AMBA Plug&Play is used to discover the AHBSTAT peripheral.

Included in this directory is also a GRMON script which can be used to inject
single bit error in RAM.

The example reads/writes with MMU and cache bypass (ASI 0x1C), which means that
it operates on physical addresses and there is not need to temporarily disable
MMU or cache.

The example should work on UT699E, UT700, GR712RC and more components out of
the box. But it is not compatible with UT699, due to lack of the casa
instruction.
