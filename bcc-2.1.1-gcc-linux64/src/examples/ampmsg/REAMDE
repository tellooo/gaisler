# ABOUT
This directory contains a BCC2 AMP example which demonstrates:

- How to provide AMP related information to a BCC2 application
- Multi-processor lock using SPARC ldstub on shared memory location
- Simple job dispatching on other in-system processors
- GRMON2 setup for running AMP application
- BCC2 functionality for processor start and power down

For more information on messages and ports, see msg.h.


# BUILD
GR712RC and GR740 is supported. Two processors are used in both cases. In the
ampmsg directory, issue:

  $ make BSP=gr712rc clean all
OR 
  $ make BSP=gr740 clean all


# RUN
A GRMON2 script is created as part of building the example. It is named
ampmsg.tcl and can be used like this:

  $ grmon <debuglink> -u
  [...]
  grmon2> batch ampmsg.tcl
  [...]
  grmon2> run
  [...]


# DEBUG
Mutex debugging can be enabled by setting the define "MUTEX_DEBUG" to 1 (in
mutex.c or with gcc -DMUTEX_DEBUG=1).

Interesting places to put breakpoints are
  - mutex_lock()
  - mutex_lock()
Note that these symbols appear once per CPU, so use the GRMON2 commands 'cpu
<index>' and 'bp hard <symbol> cpux'.
