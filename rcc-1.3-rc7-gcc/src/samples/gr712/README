GR712 SAMPLES
-------------

The sample RTEMS application found in this directory are specific for the
RCC RTEMS GR712RC release. The standard examples available RCC (../) are
also working for the GR712RC when compiled for LEON3.

rtems-ascs         - ASCS RTEMS driver demonstration application
rtems-satcan.c     - SATCAN and CANMUX RTEMS driver demonstration application
rtems-slink.c      - SLINK RTEMS driver demonstration application

When building the examples it is possible to control the behaviour by setting the following variables.

CPU         - By setting the CPU variable to one of the cpu-targets, then the hardware specific flags for that cpu-target will be added when compiling.
CFLAGS      - Override common compilation flags
CPUFLAGS    - Override the hardware specific compilation flags
MKPROMFLAGS - Override mkprom2 flags

TMTC

TM and TC examples are available separately in the TMTC stack.
